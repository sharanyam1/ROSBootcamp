# ROSBootcamp
Repository that talks about all basic features of ROS as a part of the ROS Boot camp

1.â€‹      What is ROS? Name its merits and limitations for roboticists?

ans : It is a META operating system which provides services like hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality,message-passing between processes, and package management 

merits :

Allows flexibility for code written in ROS to be run in other robotics software frameworks

Allows you to adopt the code written by other developers for your project

Allows easier management of complicated multi-board robots 

Most commercial sensors and actuators have ROS drivers

Limitations :

Powerful hardware required to run ROS on your robot 

Not useful when developing novel applications where reusing of packages is not preferred , and thus requires lots of time-consuming modifications

Not a real-time system 

Security issues for industrial development scenario

2.  Define the basic ROS terminologies of  :

   a. Workspace : It is the collection of different packages 

   b. ROS packages : They are the main organizational software units of ROS which contains nodes ,libraries ,datasets and config files

   c. Nodes : Nodes are the processes that perform computation 

   d. Topics : Channels through which messages are passed . It is the name given to identify the contents of the messages being passed.

   e. Messages : Nodes communicate with each other by passing messages. It is just a data-structure 

   f. Services : Enables request/reply interactions in distributed systems
